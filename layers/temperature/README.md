# Data

The temperature layers are based on the data provided by the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). The variable *2m temperature* from the dataset *ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present* is used (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview):
> This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (Â°C) by subtracting 273.15.

# 80-89to15-19

The temperature from 1980 till 1989 is averaged and compared with the average of the most recent complete five years (2015 till 2019).
