# Description

We use modified Copernicus Sentinel level 3 (rastered) data from the Sentinel-5P satellite. The tiles used by the web map are hosted here.

These are the steps that have to be done to obtain NO2 tiles on the map you can see on [map.decarbnow.space](https://map.decarbnow.space)

- Download the yearly NO2 geotiffs from the Viewer tool on [terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en). 
- Import the geotiff raster files to QGIS. 
- Set the color palette. 
- Generate XYZ tiles to a directory.
