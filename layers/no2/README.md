# Description

NO2 is created by burning fossil fuels; the same process that creates CO2. The main sources of NO2 are traffic and energy production from e.g. coal or oil. Diesel engines that are a well known source of particulates account for a high proportion of NO2 spillage. Hence, by getting rid of NO2 also other problems connected to burning fossil fuels can be reduced. We use two sources, data from NASA OMI data and ESA Sentinel-5p:
